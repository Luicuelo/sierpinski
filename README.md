# Sierpinski

This repository provides a Java implementation of the Sierpinski triangle fractal. The Sierpinski triangle is a self-similar, recursive geometric structure widely used as an example in mathematics and computer graphics.

## Features

- Generates and displays the Sierpinski triangle fractal.
- Written in Java for easy execution and modification.
- Educational for learning about fractals and recursion.

## What is the Sierpinski Triangle?

The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles. It is a classic example of a recursive structure and has applications in computer graphics, mathematics, and art.
